RP2350
======

Introduction
------------

RP2350 features a dual-core Arm Cortex-M33 processor with 520 kiB on-chip SRAM,
support for up to 16MB of off-chip flash and a wide range of flexible I/O option
including I2C, SPI, and - uniquely - Programmable I/O (PIO). With its security
features RP2350 offers significant enhancements over RP2040.

This platform port supports TF-M regression tests (Secure and Non-secure)
with Isolation Level 1 and 2.

.. note::

   Only GNU toolchain is supported.

.. note::

   Only "profile_medium" predefined profile is supported.

Building TF-M
-------------

Follow the instructions in :doc:`Building instructions </building/tfm_build_instruction>`.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build instructions with platform name: rpi/rp2350
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=rpi/rp2350``

.. note::

   This platform port relies on
   `Raspberry Pi Pico SDK <https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk>`__.
   Make sure it is either cloned locally or available to download during build.
   SDK version used for testing: SDK 2.1.1 release.

.. note::

   Building the default platform configuration requires the board to be
   provisioned. For this the provision bundle needs to be built and run on the
   board with ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF``. The binary must be
   placed in flash at the address defined by ``PROVISIONING_BUNDLE_START``. One
   way to do this is to generate a .uf2 file containing the bundle at the start
   address and copy it to the board. There is an example in the provided
   pico_uf2.sh script and in the description below.

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and
   ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=ON`` then the keys in the
   ``<TF-M source dir>/platform/ext/common/provisioning_bundle/provisioning_config.cmake``
   and the default MCUBoot signing keys will be used for provisioning.

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and
   ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=OFF`` are set then unique values can be used for
   provisioning. The keys and seeds can be changed by passing the new values to
   the build command, or by setting the ``-DPROVISIONING_KEYS_CONFIG`` flag to a
   .cmake file that contains the keys. An example config cmake file can be seen
   at
   ``<TF-M source dir>/platform/ext/common/provisioning_bundle/provisioning_config.cmake``.
   Otherwise new random values are going to be generated and used. For the image
   signing the ${MCUBOOT_KEY_S} and ${MCUBOOT_KEY_NS} will be used. These
   variables should point to .pem files that contain the code signing private
   keys. The public keys are going to be generated from these private keys and
   will be used for provisioning. The hash of the public key is going to be
   written into the ``provisioning_data.c`` automatically.

   If ``-DMCUBOOT_GENERATE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=ON`` is set then a new mcuboot
   signing public and private keypair is going to be generated and it's going to
   be used to sign the S and NS binaries.

   The new generated keypair can be found in the ``<build dir>/bin`` folder or
   in the ``<install directory>/image_signing/keys`` after installation.
   The generated provisioning_data.c file can be found at
   ``<build dir>/platform/target/provisioning/provisioning_data.c``

.. note::

   The provisioning bundle generation depends on pyelftools that needs to be
   installed via::

    pip3 install pyelftools

Building Secure side with provisioning bundle:

.. note::

   Add optionally:

   - -DTFM_MULTI_CORE_TOPOLOGY=ON for multicore support
   - -DPICO_SDK_PATH=<abs-path-to-pico-sdk> for a pre-fetched Pico SDK

.. code-block:: bash

     cmake -S <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/spe \
     -B <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/spe/build_rpi_single \
     -DTFM_PLATFORM=rpi/rp2350 \
     -DTFM_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<TF-M source dir>/toolchain_GNUARM.cmake \
     -DCONFIG_TFM_SOURCE_PATH=<TF-M source dir> \
     -DTFM_PROFILE=profile_medium \
     -DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF \
     -DTEST_S=ON \
     -DTEST_NS=ON

.. code-block:: bash

     cmake --build <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/spe/build_rpi_single \
     -- -j8 install


Building Non-Secure side:

.. code-block:: bash

     cmake -S <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg \
     -B <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/build_rpi_single \
     -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=<TF-M tests source dir>/tests_reg/spe/build_rpi_single/api_ns \
     -DTFM_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/spe/build_rpi_single/api_ns/cmake/toolchain_ns_GNUARM.cmake

.. code-block:: bash

     cmake --build <TF-M-tests source dir>/tests_reg/build_rpi_single -- -j8

Binaries need to be converted with a small script pico_uf2.sh.
It requires uf2conv.py from here:
https://github.com/microsoft/uf2/blob/master/utils/uf2conv.py.
It depends on:
https://github.com/microsoft/uf2/blob/master/utils/uf2families.json.
Both the above files need to be copied into the same place where pico_uf2.sh
runs.
Also, you may need to give executable permissions to both pico_uf2.sh and
uf2conv.py.
The tool takes the combined and signed S and NS images in .bin format, and
generates the corresponding .uf2 file. It also generates the .uf2 for the
bootloader (bl2.uf2) and the provisioning bundle one.

.. code-block:: bash

     pico_uf2.sh <TF-M-tests source dir> build_rpi_single

Then just copy (drag-and-drop) the bl2.uf2 and tfm_s_ns_signed.uf2 files into
the board, one at time. It will run the BL2, S and NS tests and print the
results to the UART (Baudrate 115200).
If the board needs provisioning, the .uf2 file containing the provisioning
bundle needs to be copied before tfm_s_ns_signed.uf2. It only needs to be
done once.

.. note::

   If a different application was copied to the board before, erasing the flash
   might be necessary.

Erasing the flash:

Generating flash sized image of zeros can be done with the truncate command,
then it can be converted to the uf2 format with the uf2conv.py utility. The
resulting uf2 file then needs to be copied to the board. Current platform flash
size is 2MB, please adjust size based on your board specs
( ``PICO_FLASH_SIZE_BYTES`` ):

.. code-block:: bash

   truncate -s 2M nullbytes2M.bin
   uf2conv.py nullbytes2M.bin --base 0x10000000 --convert --output nullbytes2M.uf2 --family 0xe48bff59
